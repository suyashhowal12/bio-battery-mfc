# Revolution of Bio-Batteries ⚡🌱
**Harnessing Biology for Sustainable Energy**

This project explores the development and potential of **Bio-Batteries** using **Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs)** to convert organic waste into low-voltage electricity — offering a clean, renewable, and sustainable alternative to traditional energy storage systems.

---

## 🔬 Project Overview
- Researched bio-electrochemical systems and designed a **prototype concept** using MFCs.
- Utilized **electroactive microorganisms** that break down organic matter and release electrons.
- Simulated the generation of electricity from **organic waste materials** (e.g., vegetable peels, wastewater).
- Proposed design improvements to enhance voltage output and microbial efficiency.

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle
- **Microbial Fuel Cells** use bacteria as the catalyst to oxidize organic matter.
- The electrons released in this process travel via an external circuit, generating usable current.
- A basic MFC includes:  
  - Anode chamber (organic waste + bacteria)  
  - Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM)  
  - Cathode (oxygen reduction reaction)

---

## 📊 Key Outcomes
- Generated low-voltage electricity in lab-simulated setup (~0.4–0.8V per cell).
- Identified scalability challenges and proposed multi-cell stacking method.
- Gained insights into sustainable energy systems and eco-innovation.
